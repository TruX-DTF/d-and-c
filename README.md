# Setup:

	In order to run the code, python3 is necessary with the additional libraries such as LightGBM.

Extract the archives allResults.db.7z and simiSmall.h5 2.7z.00X which are containing the prediction probabilities of all the classifies and similarity score of the bug report / source code files pairs used in the study.


# Code Structure:

	train.py
	
		The training module: Please change the local variable 'xgbResultFolder' which points
		to the simiSmall.h5 database and save the trained models.

	predict.py
	
		The prediction module: It uses the similarity database (simiSmall.h5) and the trained
		models to make the predictions. The results of the prediction are saved to be used 
		in the evaluation (eval.py) module

	results/
		The folders that is containing the prediction probabilities of the D&C classifiers 
		(Name_of_the_Classifier\_TESTALLEpredProb.pickle)
		
		confusionMatrix/ The confusion matrices that describe the performance of classification
		models 	MAP and MRR values computes (files that are finising with MRR.pick)
	
		allResults.db.7z : The SQL database containing all the prediction probabilities, 
		which is used to combine the classifiers into a single one.

	eval.py
	
		The evaluation module: It uses the predictions produced by the prediction 
		module (predict.py); merge into a result database (allResults.db, or loads if 
		it is already available) and computes the MAP and MRR values of the D&C with 
		different combination strageties (max,min,prod,mean etc..) and finally 
		compare the results with the state-of-art approaches.
		
	models/
	
		The models that trained in the training module.

# File Look-up:

	results-state-of-the-art.xlsx
	
		The MAP, MRR, Top1, Top5, Top10 results of the state-of-the-art approaches.
		
	bugFixingCommits.txt
	
		The file that contains the commit ids of the commits and the bug reports ids 
		of the projects that are used in our experiment.
		
	filteredBugFixingCommits.txt
	
		The filtered bug reports, as described in our paper.
		
	allTeknik.pickle
	
		The MAP, MRR, Top1, Top5, Top10 results of the state-of-the-art approaches 
		for the whole dataset.
		
	idFramesTeknikFiltered.pickle
	
		The MAP, MRR, Top1, Top5, Top10 results of the state-of-the-art approaches,
		filtered, as described in the paper.
		
	groundTruthAnswer.pickle
	
		The ground truth object, indicating which are the actually buggy 
		bug-report / source code pairs.
